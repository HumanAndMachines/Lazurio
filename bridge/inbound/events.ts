// bridge/inbound — the Zulip Events API poller. This is how Buddy hears.
//
// WHAT IT REPLACED, AND WHY. Buddy used to be an OUTGOING-WEBHOOK bot: Zulip
// POSTed to an HTTP listener the bridge ran on :9081. That put an inbound
// listener for the appliance INSIDE the appliance's own network, and every hop
// of the resulting path had to be bought with an artifact — an entry in Zulip's
// Smokescreen SSRF allow-list, a pinned container address so that entry stayed
// narrow, a container→host ufw rule so the bridge could reach the runtime, and an
// /etc/hosts hairpin so the reply could get back in. Four artifacts, each a
// permanent line item in every future host's boundary evidence, all bought by
// one structural choice. As a GENERIC bot the bridge only ever DIALS OUT, on
// loopback, and all four artifacts are gone.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS IN EXCHANGE, stated honestly because each item is real code:
//   * Zulip no longer decides what Buddy sees. A Generic bot's queue delivers
//     every message in every channel it is subscribed to, so the trigger
//     predicate and the self-echo filter are OURS (message.ts), and the turn
//     breaker is the second line of defence behind them (turn-breaker.ts).
//   * The event queue is state we hold a handle to and do not own. It is
//     garbage-collected after ten minutes idle and it dies with the appliance,
//     so `BAD_EVENT_QUEUE_ID` is a NORMAL state transition — every reboot and
//     every `docker compose down/up` produces one — with its own recovery path.
//   * `last_event_id` is a cursor inside one queue's lifetime and nothing more.
//     The durable anchor is the message-id watermark (watermark.ts).
//
// THE ORDERING RULE, which is the one thing here that must be exactly right:
//
//     durable record  →  watermark  →  last_event_id
//
// A crash anywhere in that sequence is safe. Reverse the first two and a crash
// between them puts a message BELOW the watermark with no record: catch-up will
// never re-fetch it and the queue will never re-deliver it. That is a silently
// lost user message, and it is the only ordering mistake that produces one.
