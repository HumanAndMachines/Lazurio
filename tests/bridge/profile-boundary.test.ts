// COVERS: the in-process custody gate on the ONE directory the input-facing
// bridge may open. That the judgement is made on the RESOLVED path (a symlink and
// a `..` are collapsed first, so a path that spells the profile and points at the
// memory repo is judged as the memory repo); that a Personalspace root declared
// one directory too high is refused; that a secret-shaped file inside the profile
// is refused with its name listed; that NOTHING DECLARED is a refusal and not a
// default; and that the refusal is loud, carries a remedy, and never quotes the
// Principal's own text.
//
// DOES NOT COVER: participant authorization or Agent tool access. The private
// communication surface admits only the Principal, while Hermes owns the Agent
// sandbox. The bridge's separate uid is ordinary process isolation. Whether it
// exists, can traverse to the profile and can read its contracts are host facts
// owned by the install seam. Nor does this file prove containment: "is this path
// inside the Personalspace?" is not decidable from a bare path, which is why the
// gate judges the directory's CONTENT contract instead.
